Main thread starts executing. hello
Initial value of top = 3.
Initial value of stack top = d.
Main thread will now fork several threads.
Two Consumer threads have been created.
Two Producer threads have been created.
One CharStackProber thread has been created.
Consumer thread [TID=1] starts executing.
Consumer thread [TID=1] pops character =d
Producer thread [TID=3] starts executing.
Producer thread [TID=3] pushes character =c

Consumer thread [TID=1] pops character =e
Producer thread [TID=3] terminates.
CharStackProber thread [TID=5] starts executing.

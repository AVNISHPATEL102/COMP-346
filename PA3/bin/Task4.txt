Task 4
If we used "Notify" instead of "NotifyAll" this would cause starvation, due to the arbitrary call to a yielded thread. 
So the possibility that a certain thread does not get called over and over is plausible, but as you can see, using the "NotifyAll" call, 
will notify any thread that is waiting and give them all a fair chance to enter the critical section.
